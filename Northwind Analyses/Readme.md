## Northwind Sales and order Analyses

The dataset consist of information regarding the sale,revenue and cost of shipping for products .
The aim was to dig through to summarise and identify insights and trends that will be very useful
in making informed decisions.
The fields in the dataset include categories, different products, prices of products, order 
quantities, shipping cost and companies, various customers and many other fields.

The tools used for this analysis is Power BI, where I cleaned the data, explored and created measures
and news columns using DAX .

### Some Question I sort to answer were :

i. Which categories are producing more revenue?

ii. What are the Top and least revenue generating products ?

iii. Which customers are purchasing more and generating more revenue?

iv.What products have been discontinued ? etc
