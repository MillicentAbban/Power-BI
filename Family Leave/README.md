### Insights

-The analysis indicates that on the average paternity leave offered is 7.3 weeks which is lesser that 10.9 weeks 
that mothers are offered.

-Also, the most common number of weeks offered to mother is 12 weeks which is 50% more than what is offered to fathers.

In brief, Paternity leave is offered less to parents among these companies and it is something that should be considered 
more which will in the long run take away some of the pressure experienced by mothers after childbirth.
