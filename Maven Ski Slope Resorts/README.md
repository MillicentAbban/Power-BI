The purpose of this project is to create that one dashboard which will assist a potential 
skier in choosing the perfect place for themselves.
The Dataset consisted of two table, Resorts, which contained resort name, location, price,
countries, continents, seasons(months), the various heights, the different types of slopes
among others whilst the Snow table consisted of the locations, months and the percentage of 
snowfall each month.

## Data Wrangling
- I started of by double checking the data types for each column to make sure they are correct.
- I realized some of the resort name were not right, some resort have long long names and seem 
to have been sepeated.After a desktop seach i combine those names that are suppose to be one 
instead of seperated.
- I also removed unwanted characters that were present in the resort names.
- In the snow table, I transformed the percent column into actual percentages that was needed
- for my visualization .
## Outcome
What i sort to create was a dashboard that can can a ski-er when picking the idea place to go to.
To enhance their experience be it a Novice, Intermediate or an Expert , i provided various options
for them to choose from. Options rand from child friendly resorts, summer- skiing, night skiing, 
snow parks, budget and country of choice.
In the end user friendly dashboard was created which will completely help skiers
