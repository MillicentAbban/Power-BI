# An Analysis of Lego Sets over a Period of 5 Decades.
This is an analysis of Lego data from the year 1970 to 2022 to explore the 
history and the evolution of Lego sets.
The analyses started with EDA to identify, patterns, trends, outliers and unexpected
features that are present.
## Data Cleaning
The data had quite a number of missing values that needed to be addressed. In this
case I did some desktop research to help me fill out some of the values and the 
rest I filled out with a N/A when the data type was a string and 0 if the value was
an integer.
The rationale behind this and not replacing the missing integer values with an average 
of the entire column was that it could affect the outcome of the analysis and produce 
results that might be off.
